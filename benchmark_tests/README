### Benchmarking with Snakemake
we used snakemake to define the following pipeline:
    - 1. Random tree set generation with N trees and M tips;
    - 2. Analysis with Pear;
    - 3. Analysis with TreeDist;
    - 4. Analysis with TreeSpace.

Snakemake submits the jobs on available cores, and the workload manager of the hpc autogenerates reports for space and time usage.
