** Samples of Phylogenetic Trees

The large biological tree collections used in this study were obtained
from two recent Bayesian analyses.

- 20,000 trees obtained from a Bayesian analysis of an alignment
of 150 taxa (23 desert taxa and 127 others from freshwater,
marine, ands oil habitats) with 1,651 aligned sites [1]. The
majority and strict consensus resolution rates for these 20,000
trees are 87% and 34%, respectively.
- 33,306 trees obtained froman analysis of a three-gene, 567 taxa
(560 angiosperms, seven outgroups) dataset with 4,621 aligned
characters, which is one of the largest Bayesian analyses done
to date [2]. The majority and strict consensus resolution rates
for these 33,306 trees are 93% and 51%, respectively.

The sample trees are randomly selected from the above data tree sets.
- 150-taxa-10-trees.tre: 150 taxa, 10 trees.
- 150-taxa-100-trees.tre: 150 taxa, 100 trees.
- 150-taxa-1000-trees.tre: 150 taxa, 1000 trees.
- 567-taxa-10-trees.tre: 567 taxa, 10 trees.
- 567-taxa-100-trees.tre: 567 taxa, 100 trees.
- 567-taxa-1000-trees.tre: 567 taxa, 1000 trees.
